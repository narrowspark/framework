## Support Policy
Starting from the Narrowspark 1.x branch, the number of minor versions is limited to five per branch (X.0, X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4).
The last minor version of a branch (e.g. 1.4, 2.4, 3.4) is considered a long-term support version and the other ones are considered standard versions:

|       Version Type      | Bugs are fixed for... | Security issues are fixed for... |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
|        Standard         |        6 months       |              1 year              |
| Long-Term Support (LTS) |        2 years        |              3 years             |

Once the two years of support are completed, the branch reaches its end of life and is no longer supported.
[A table of end of life branches is available.](04_End_Of_Live.md)
