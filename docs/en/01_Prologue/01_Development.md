## Development
The full development period for any major or minor version lasts six months and is divided into two phases:

* **Development**: Four months to add new features and to enhance existing ones;
* **Stabilization**: Two months to fix bugs, prepare the release, and wait for the whole Narrowspark ecosystem (third-party libraries and projects using Narrowspark) to catch up.

During the development phase, any new feature can be reverted if it won’t be finished in time or if it won’t be stable enough to be included in the current final release.
