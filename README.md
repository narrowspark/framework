> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Narrowspark framework. If you want to build an application using Narrowspark, visit the main [Narrowspark repository][2].

[Narrowspark][1] is a **PHP framework** for web applications and a set of reusable
**PHP components** with expressive, elegant syntax. Narrowspark attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

* Powerful dependency injection container.
* Multiple back-ends for session and cache storage.
* A powerful console "cerebro" based on [Symfony Console][5]
* Simple, fast routing engine.

Narrowspark is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
